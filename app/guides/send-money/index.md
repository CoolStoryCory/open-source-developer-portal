# Overview: Send money to your users

In this guide, we’ll cover the key points of transferring money:

- On-board a receiving customer for the funds transfer
- Associate a funding source (bank or credit union account) with the customer
- Transfer fund to a customer's linked account

### Before you begin

You need to have a [Sandbox account](/guides/sandbox-setup) already set up.

### Next step: Onboarding and Customer creation

The first step is to onboard recipients for your transfer, along with ensuring a funding source is added where money will be sent. Dwolla’s branded experience prompts your recipients for their bank or credit union account information. Otherwise, if you choose to integrate with the Dwolla API, your application will need to capture the recipient's bank account information to pass through to Dwolla for secure storage.
