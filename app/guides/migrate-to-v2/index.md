# Migrate to v2

## Overview
The following guide will outline some of the underlying principles of our v2 API and provide guidance on upgrading your application from Dwolla’s legacy v1 API. Reference our [v2 API docs](https://docsv2.dwolla.com/) for more information on the functionality currently available.

Dwolla’s v2 API supports most of the same features and functionality as API v1; methods that are not currently supported in v2 are under Product consideration. Any new functionality added to the Dwolla platform will only be added to v2. 

API v2 is a RESTful API. It follows best practices in its design and improves on the developer experience from the now legacy v1 API. With its new design, we recommend allocating sufficient time to migrate and test with v2 leading up to the v1 retirement date.
