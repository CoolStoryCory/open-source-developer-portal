# Overview: Migrate to the Dwolla v2 API

The following guide will outline some of the underlying principles of our Dwolla v2 API and provide guidance on upgrading your application from Dwollaâ€™s legacy v1 API. Reference our [API docs](https://docsv2.dwolla.com/) for more information on the functionality currently available.

The Dwolla v2 API supports most of the same features and functionality as API v1; methods that are not currently supported in the Dwolla v2 API are under Product consideration. Any new functionality added to the Dwolla platform will only be added to the Dwolla v2 API.

Dwolla's v2 API is a RESTful API. It follows best practices in its design and improves on the developer experience from the now legacy v1 API.
