# Authentication

The way in which you interact with Dwollaâ€™s authorization server will remain **unchanged**. OAuth user account access tokens that are currently issued to applications leveraging v1 can be used to call various Access API endpoints. 

Scopes used in the Access API: `Send`, `Transactions`, `Funding`, `AccountInfoFull`, and `ManageCustomers`.

In v1, some API endpoints only require your application key and secret (for instance, creating a checkout or looking up a user), but most require an OAuth access token. In the Access API, all API endpoints require either an OAuth user **account access_token** or an **application access_token** in order to authenticate. Application access tokens are new and only used to access protected resources that belong to the application itself including: webhooks, webhook-subscriptions, and events.

For endpoints that require an OAuth access token, it should be included in the Authorization HTTP header like so: `Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN_HERE>`.
