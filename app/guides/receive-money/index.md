# Overview: Receive money from your users

In this guide, we’ll cover the key points of collecting money from your customers by utilizing the Dwolla API.

- Create a sending customer for the funds transfer
- Associate a verified funding source (bank or credit union account) with the customer
- Transfer funds from the customer’s linked funding source (bank account)

### Before you begin

You need to have a [Sandbox account](/guides/sandbox-setup) already set up.

### Next step: Customer onboarding

The first step is to create senders for your transfer, along with adding a funding source (bank account) where the money will be sent from. Your application will need to capture these fields to pass through to Dwolla for secure storage.
