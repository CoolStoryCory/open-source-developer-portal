# Dwolla.js

## Using Dwolla.js for On-demand bank transfers
On-demand bank transfers allow Dwolla customers to receive variable totals from a payer’s bank account via an ACH transaction—perfect for companies with usage-based business models, such as utilities or advertising platforms. No other third-party gateways or merchant accounts required, just your Dwolla integration and payer authorization.

This is application setting for your Dwolla Master Account. When enabled, the end user is presented with text on the bank selection screen within the IAV flow giving authorization to Dwolla for future variable payments.
