## Preemptively refresh authorization

You set up a cron job that runs in the background every hour to refresh each user accountâ€™s OAuth access token. Refreshing authorization would happen behind the scenes as a backend process. You would first query your database for tokens that are about to expire, make a POST request to refresh authorization, and update your database to include the newly refreshed token pair. Note: Be prepared to handle errors gracefully while the cron job is running.
