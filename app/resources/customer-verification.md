# Customer Verification

This article will walk through the identity verification process for verified Customers within the Dwolla API. For more information on going live with the Dwolla API, please [contact sales](https://www.dwolla.com/contact).

A `Customer` represents an individual or business that intends to send or receive funds on your platform. In any transaction at least one party—either the sender or the recipient—must complete the [identity verification](https://www.dwolla.com/updates/guide-to-cip-customer-identification-program-dwolla-payments-api/) process as outlined in this article. In cases where a Customer is only sending funds to or receiving funds from your full Dwolla account, the Customer is not required to complete the process set out below.

First, you should have an active [webhook subscription](https://docsv2.dwolla.com/#webhook-subscriptions). This active webhook subscription allows information about a Customer’s `status` in the verification process to be sent asynchronously to your application.
## Quick overview
We’ll outline the verification process for both `personal` and `business` Customers.

3. [Handling verification statuses](/resources/customer-verification/handling-verification-statuses.html)
