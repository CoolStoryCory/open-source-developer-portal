# Bank transfer workflow

## Transfer failures

There are several reasons bank transfers can fail, a few of which are outlined below. When a transfer fails it is usually a result of an ACH failure which is assigned an ACH return code after being rejected from the financial institution. A few common failure cases include:

- **Insufficient Funds (R01):** Pending transfers can fail due to insufficient funds from the source bank account. 
- **No Account/Unable to Locate Account (R03):** The recipient of a transfer has closed their bank account or has incorrectly entered their bank account/routing number when attaching their funding source.
- **Customer Advises Not Authorized (R10):** The owner of a bank account has told their bank that this transfer was unauthorized.

### What occurs in the Dwolla system when a bank transfer fails?

Bank accounts will automatically be removed from the Dwolla system for all ACH return codes except an `R01`. If subscribed to webhooks, your application will receieve a webhook with the `funding_source_removed` event along with the `transfer_failed` event.

When a bank transfer fails from a verified account (e.g. [Traditional CIP Verified](/resources/account-types/traditional-accounts.html) or [Access API Verified Customer](/resources/account-types/access-api-accounts.html) to a recipient), funds will return to the sending account’s Dwolla balance. For other transfer scenarios, funds will return to the source bank account. 

### Retrieving the reason for a failed bank transfer

When a bank transfer fails its status will be updated to `failed`. If your application is subscribed to webhooks, you’ll receive either the `transfer_failed` event if the transfer belongs to a Dwolla account or the `customer_transfer_failed` event if the transfer belongs to an Access API Customer. The event contains a links to the associated account as well as the transfer resource. To get the return code and reason for the transfer failure you’ll first retrieve the transfer by its ID.

Dwolla returns a `failure` link within the response that can be used to lookup the ACH return code and corresponding description.
